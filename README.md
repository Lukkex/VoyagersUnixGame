# VoyagersUnixGame
A UNIX-based game I created for one of my classes back in 2022

# Compiling the Game
To compile the game, you will need GCC installed properly.

With GCC, run "gcc finalproject.asm -o finalproject.o"

# Running the Game
To run the game, enter "./finalproject.o" into the terminal after compilation.

Enjoy!
